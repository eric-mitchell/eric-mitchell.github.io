      If you can stomach it, there's a video of my playing this song a long, <b>long</b> time ago <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EricMitchellMusic/videos">on YouTube</a> (I'm not sure I can even log into this YouTube account any more). The song's gotten a new name since then.

      <blockquote>
	6 miles to Manhattan<br/>
	and a thousand more back home.<br/>
	If it's something you can find<br/>
	you'll have to go alone.<br/>
	<br/>
	Otherwise pick up the phone<br/>
	because I'm ready to talk again.<br/>
	Harbor lights like tiny fights<br/>
	waging their war for us.<br/>
	<br/>
	It's like we're in a race<br/>
	but the faster you go the more I slow.<br/> 
	Today has me shaking<br/>
	and I can't help but wake<br/>
	<br/>
	When my dreams<br/>
	stumble up to you.<br/>
	When my dreams<br/>
	They stumble<br/>
	<br/>
	When the lights on the highway<br/>
	remind me what’s still there.<br/>
	I’m missing what they’re saying;<br/>
	The way I live keeps me aware.<br/>
	<br/>
	That those thoughts that love to bring me<br/>
	out from the depths of your salty sea.<br/>
	Remind me I’m alive when they take<br/>
	the last love from my empty plate.<br/>
	<br/>
	Something with the travel<br/>
	Makes me think I’ll unravel<br/>
	And I feel so old<br/>
	With fear frozen cold<br/>
	<br/>
	When my dreams<br/>
	tumble up to you.<br/>
	When my dreams<br/>
	They stumble<br/>

      An iphone-quality recording of a little piece i wrote a while ago. Rough, but it gets the point across.

      A song about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucius_Quinctius_Cincinnatus">Cincinnatus</a>, the "Roman guy who went back to farming," quoth Google autocomplete. My sister <a href="https://www.oliviamitchell.net/">Olivia</a> helped out.
      
      <blockquote>
	These people<br />
	All around her<br />
	Get to talking<br />
	<br />
	The very same people<br />
	Think they love her<br />
	The throb of power<br />
	<br />
	Wade through it all<br />
	Thick as tar<br />
	Already seems so far<br />
	<br />
	What happened to family?<br />
	The ones who hold you<br />
	Drowning in the fog<br />
	<br />
	She said what the hell<br />
	It’s just as well<br />
	I’ll see you in the morning<br />
	Just a couple days<br />
	Or a few more years<br />
	I was cruising now I’m choosing<br />
	To give it all back<br />
	Walk the other way<br />
	There’s a star that’s burning brighter<br />
	When they look my way<br />
	I have to say<br />
	Cincinnatus<br />
	<br />
	When the people<br />
	Come a calling<br />
	What does he do?<br />
	What does he say?<br />
	<br />
	Goodbye to family<br />
	Gets his white suit<br />
	Plays the war games<br />
	<br />
	The dust begins to swell<br />
	Shades of purple<br />
	Ivory armor<br />
	<br />
	Proud Romans<br />
	Prepare for battle<br />
	Mercy for the enemy<br />
	<br />
	He said what the hell<br />
	It’s just as well<br />
	I’ll see you in the morning<br />
	Just a couple days<br />
	Or a few more years<br />
	I was cruising now I’m choosing<br />
	To give it all back<br />
	Walk the other way<br />
	There’s a star that’s burning brighter<br />
	Through a different lens<br />
	I have to say<br />
	<br />
	Oh Cincinnatus<br />
