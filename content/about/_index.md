**Fall 2023 update: I am going on both the industry and academic job markets very shortly (early 2024). If you think my experience would be a good fit for your organization or institution, reach out! You can find my CV [here][CV].**

I am a final-year PhD student in Stanford's CS department, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Chelsea Finn][1] and [Christopher D. Manning][2]. The goal of my research is to make foundation models, particularly language models, a more trustworthy and easy to use technology. Much of my PhD has been generously supported by a [Knight-Hennessy Graduate Fellowship][KH] and a Stanford Accelerator for Learning grant for [Generative AI for the Future of Learning][genai].

In the summer of 2022, I was a research scientist intern at DeepMind in London, where I was lucky to spend four months working with [Junyoung Chung][junyoung], [Nate Kushman][nate], and [AÃ¤ron van den Oord][aaron].

Before my PhD, I was a research engineer at [Samsung's AI Center][5] in New York City, where I learned constantly from [Volkan Isler][6], [Daniel D. Lee][7], and many other wonderful (and patient) people. As an undergraduate, I completed my thesis under the guidance of [H. Sebastian Seung][10] after many hours in the [Seung Lab][8] at the [Princeton Neuroscience Institute][9]. I also competed for [Princeton's varsity men's golf team][X].

In my free time, I make music for guitar and voice. I enjoy the outdoors, particularly playing golf, exploring mountains, and SCUBA diving.
